This is a tutorial project from @www.trufflesuite.com box [tutorial](https://www.trufflesuite.com/tutorials/pet-shop) projects.
The purpose of this project is to be more familiarize with Ethereum dapp development.

The tutorial is covering the following topics:

    1.Setting up the development environment
    2.Creating a Truffle project using a Truffle Box
    3.Writing the smart contract
    4.Compiling and migrating the smart contract
    5.Testing the smart contract
    6.Creating a user interface to interact with the smart contract
    7.Interacting with the dapp in a browser
    
## What this dapp will do:
"Noah's Ark" Pet Shop is interested in using Ethereum as an efficient way to handle their pet adoptions. 
The store has space for 16 pets at a given time, and they already have a database of pets.
As an initial proof of concept, Pete wants to see a dapp which associates an Ethereum address
 with a pet to be adopted.
 
### Technology used for this project:
    - Solidity (language for implementing smart contracts)
    - Ganache (private blockachain for Ethereum developmen)
    - npm
    - js  
    
### Run pet-shop dapp:
    npm install
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate
    npm run dev

To explore the pet-shop dapp you have to running a GanacheUI and Metamask plugin configured
to connect at the locale blockchain created by Ganache.
